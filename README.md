# StudentLogin-VIT
Custom Extension for VIT academics.

Installation (assuming Firefox)

Install the Stylish extension to manage your userstyles; once installed, 
just click on "Write New Style", give it a name, and paste the CSS there.

You can also use this CSS with [Auto Captcha for Chrome] (http://karthikb351.github.io/AutoCaptcha-for-Chrome/) provided by Karthik Balakrishnan to have a better experience.

The extension is in development, contributions are welcome.
